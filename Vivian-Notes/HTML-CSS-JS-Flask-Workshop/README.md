# Intro to Web Development

Welcome to the repo that goes with my LA Hacks Workshop. You'll start by learning about HTML and CSS, then you'll mix in some JavaScript and finally learn the basics of a Flask webserver on the backend.

Get started with the [HTML Basics](part_1_html/README.md) section, I'll see you there!
